# EAttendance
Attendance system for my classmates using face recognition.  

It uses face_recognition library for detecting the face, creating the encoding of the face and matching the encodings of the known faces with the unknown face.
The attendance is marked in the csv file, along with the date, time and the subject.

The GUI is made using Tkinter.

The images used for this project was images of my classmates, only one image per person is enough.
